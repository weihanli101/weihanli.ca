                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            This summer I was employed as a mobile games developer for Adknown. The company had recently
                            started this branch and there was much room for growth and development. I was amongst five
                            other coops that were employed to kick start this branch of the company. In this post I will
                            outline my experiences, my challenges, and accomplishments while at Adknown.

                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">What Adknown is All About</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Adknown is a web and app publishing company based in Guelph. They connect consumers and
                            customers together by making targeting ads delivered through mobile apps, web publishing,
                            web portals and more. They do this through analysis of Big Data and more recently adopted
                            machine learning.

                        </h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Given my position as a mobile games developer my goals included understanding and learning
                            deployment across mobile platforms (iOS and Android). Originally the company was only making
                            games for android, but knowing that Unity is well known for its cross capability I was sure
                            that I would have a chance to deploy to iOS. Also knowing the programming environment was to
                            be in Unity I wanted to take full advantage of this to exercise my object-orientated
                            programming skills.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">What My Job Was About</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            My role in Adknown was a games developer. I worked closely with others that were recently
                            recruited for the same position as I and we progress as a team developing mobile games. I
                            worked with Git and its workflow. Exercised object-orientated programming daily, programming
                            in C#. I deployed both Android and iOS applications. Elaborating more on iOS games they were
                            deployed though unity cloud since the company had a shortage of apple devices which we then
                            turned our iMac into a server to overcome that hurdle. I worked with unity’s lighting to
                            create smooth and dynamic lighting. I wrote shaders to create camera effects and applied
                            mathematical functions, theories, and vector math to develop dynamic visually appealing yet
                            efficient mobile games.
                        </p>

                            </span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Connecting my work term experience back into my academics it really fuels my passion to
                            learn computer science. Seeing practical aspects to the academic labour is like seeing crops
                            grow after you toil away at a field for times on end. I feel my experience at Adknown not
                            only taught me new things that academics couldn’t offer but also taught me how to learn. A
                            main topic from my academics that was consistently used was my algorithmic studies. I now
                            see the absolute importance in algorithm design and how runtime is such a big factor in it.
                            In university a run-time is just a number. However, in the workplace O(n) vs a O(n^2)
                            run-time difference could mean 20-40 fps increase in performance.

                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">Conclusions and Regards</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            At the end of my work term I discovered that I had made the most games out of all the co-ops
                            there. This gave me both inspiration and encouragement as I know I still have plenty of
                            games ideas that I wish to release into the marketplace. I wish to continue to exercise
                            creative, efficient, and elegant design whether in games or future projects whatever they
                            may be. I also have now tasted the fruits of my academic labour and I hope in the future I
                            will have a chance to exercise more of my academic knowledge.
                        </p>

                            I liked to thank my co-workers and superiors at Adknown for providing me with the tools,
                            opportunity and support to explore both my creative and academic side. It has truly been an
                            inspirational work term and I hope to continue to develop mobile apps in the future.

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            This fall I had the opportunity to work as a full-stack developer at <a
                                href="https://tulip.com/" style="color: #ff1a75">Tulip</a>. I was placed into the
                            development tools team and worked hand in hand with some of the most brilliant minds that
                            setup the backbone of the company’s entire infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">Digging into Tulip</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Tulip is a company that believes store associates of brick and mortar stores are key players
                            in the success or failure of that store. They aim to equip store associates with the right
                            tools to provide a thriving experience for both the associates and customers. Their
                            application is tailored towards building associate and consumer relations. Tulip does all
                            this through their mobile platform Tulip Retail.
                        </p>

                        </h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            My positon on the development tools team didn’t allow me to interact with Tulip’s platform
                            in a direct manor. Instead I worked on internal tools made for developers that made
                            developing the platform possible. I worked closely with the development operations team to
                            write efficient and scalable code, a mentality they want to push towards all development
                            teams. I participated in daily scrums and weekly sprints which solidified my role on the
                            team. My work revolved around creating an interface for AWS. Simplifying complexity so that
                            more time can be allocated towards developing the product rather than setting up back-end
                            dependences for the product.

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Throughout my work term at Tulip I worked with multiple data structures, developed
                            algorithms and had an extensive use of Git, required for team development workflow. These
                            were skills I picked up from my academics which in turn was reinforced and expanded upon
                            throughout the work term. Working at tulip made me realized the essential factor of having a
                            good foundation of computer science. A foundation built up during my study terms. Without
                            them I would have had a hard time stacking tremendous amount of new information piled on me
                            every day.

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            As my work term came to a conclusion I reflected upon what I accomplished and learnt. I
                            learnt the importance of being throughout, being wary of edge cases, and the skill of
                            debugging and reading other people’s code. I learnt that it is imperative that code is to be
                            scalable and not just made to fit the task at hand. Having added these skills to my tool set
                            I feel confident and better equipped for my next work-term wherever it may be.

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            TThis summer I worked as an Application Developer for <a href="https://left.io/"
                                style="color: #09b71a">Left</a>. I was placed in charge of making a demonstration
                            application for their API RightMesh.

                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">About Left</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Left focuses bring connectivity to the world through a decentralize system. Where most
                            technologies in our age today are client-server based Left focuses on P2P connections. Which
                            can be seen in their latest project <a href="https://www.rightmesh.io/"
                                style="color: #09b71a">RightMesh</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">My Role as an Application Developer:
                            </span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            My role in Left was to create a working android application that demonstrated their API from
                            scratch along with documentations and reports about this API’s performance. The process took
                            me through all levels of design and application. From prototyping and writing project
                            proposals in the early stages of development. To designing and implementing decentralized
                            data transfer protocols in the latter stages of development. The project took me from the
                            frontend of the application such as designing the user interface then programming it out in
                            xml. To the backend of the application where I had to architect and design how the data was
                            store and retrieved.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">Importance of Design</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Working at Left made me realize the important role that software design patterns played in
                            creating software. Left also taught me to think outside the box when approaching problems.
                            Up until now I have always worked with a client-server based mind set. Client requests
                            information, server processes it and sends back a response. However, there are many things
                            in decentralized systems that client-server side architecture will simply not work for.
                            There were many days where instead of coding I spend the day thinking about how I should
                            architecture certain features of the application. Left really made me realize importance in
                            the saying “think before you speak” in my case “think before you code”.

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            As my time at left game to an ending I reflected back and felt that I not only gain work
                            experience but a new way of approaching problems. I learned that in a sense “all roads lead
                            to rome” but some are just better than others.

                            This winter and summer term I had the pleasure to work at<a href="https://roadmunk.com/"
                                style="color: #0071e1"> Roadmunk</a>.
                            I had the opportunity to work on 3 seperate teams collaborating on different
                            aspects of the business. My experience at Roadmunk allowed to me to be involved in
                            the very core of product creation. Roadmunk gave me the opportunity to gain the
                            big picture on how a thriving company in the tech industry functioned.
                            I hope to share in this post what I have learned and experienced from my
                            8 months at Roadmunk. I aim to keep the technical jargon and specifics to
                            a minimum but rather point the focus on my experiences and thoughts.

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Roadmunk is a SaaS (Software as a Service) company that develops a
                            roadmapping tool for visualizing strategy. In doing so it eases the
                            job of conveying an organization’s strategy to its members.
                            In short, Roadmunk helps companies align their focus so they
                            can be more homogeneously geared towards a common goal.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">So what did I do?
                            </span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            My experience there was divided into 3 teams. Chronologically listed as Growth Team,
                            Features Team, and IST (Internal System Tools) Team.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">The Growth Team</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            The Growth Team is where I experienced the growing pains of the product.
                            It is also where I built a solid foundation and understanding of
                            the app’s structure. The Growth Team focused on fixing small bugs
                            from all over the place. It allowed me to get experience from all
                            aspects of the application both client side and server side.
                            A typical day in this team could start with fixing small
                            UI glitches in a view and ending with refining the signup
                            wizard’s flow. Most of the tickets triaged by this team came
                            directly from customer support. Which meant that I had the
                            opportunity to fix the pains and sores that plagued our clients.
                            Apart from building a solid foundation of the app’s structure.
                            Being on this team taught me to develop with empathy
                            (one of Roadmunks 6 core values). To put myself in the place of the user.
                            To understand the pains they face each day using the product and more
                            importantly how to fix them.

                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">The Features Team</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            Transition from Growth to Features was quite exciting.
                            I was now thrown into the very core of product creation.
                            I was no longer fixing and refining but creating and designing.
                            Being in the Features Team I had the opportunity to work
                            on new app functionality, formulate technical designs,
                            and optimize efficiency. The Features Team offered its
                            own set of challenges. Such as how to recycle existing
                            structures to more quickly build the current feature,
                            how to make the current feature function faster for
                            larger datasets etc. It moulded me to write code with
                            efficiency in mind. For more complex functionality a
                            technical design doc had to be written by the developer.
                            The technical design doc outline the changes that were going
                            to be made, what data structures were going to be used, how
                            the changes will impact the current code. The doc was then
                            to be reviewed by a senior developer or a developer who had
                            more experience in the area of code that is to be changed.
                            I had the opportunity to write some technical design docs.
                            Writing the technical design docs helped me focus my thoughts.
                            In turn creating a cleaner and more efficient solutions
                            to an existing problem. Being on the Features Team gave me the
                            chance to build on top of the foundation I established
                            in the Growth Team.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="text-align:left;">The IST Team</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
                            IST is where I spent the majority of my time. IST created the link between the
                            product and the business side of things in Roadmunk.
                            The IST team handled integrations with external applications
                            that provided metrics, customer management, billing etc.
                            Some major projects I worked on involved a Stripe to Chargebee self-serve invoice migration 
                            which involved moving <strong>$2.7 million dollars</strong> of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) 
                            from <a href="https://stripe.com/"
                            style="color: #5c67e2">Stripe</a> to <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/"
                            style="color: #e15f30">Chargebee</a>.
                            Establishing an integration from the Roadmunk app to a CRM tool called  <a href="https://www.salesforce.com"
                            style="color: #108fb9">Salesforce</a>.
                            Creating a proof of concept of the data routing application called <a href="https://segment.com/"
                            style="color: #3ba56e">Segment</a> which
                            was demoed to stakeholders. This proof of concept was later accepted and I then
                            aided in consulting the design of the Roadmunk app to Segment integration.
                            Switching from IST to Features was a big shift for me. This was my first experience
                            working in a company’s business layer. I got the opportunity to see how my work
                            directly impacted how Roadmunk functioned as a company. How I my work changed the
                            daily ins and outs of others. It was a great experience to see how a company operated
                            beyond engineering.

                            I’m grateful for the opportunity and learning experience Roadmunk provided me.
                            A huge thanks to the people in both the Toronto and Kitchener offices for making my 8 months
                            at Roadmunk memorable and enjoyable. A special thanks to Derek Veenstra and Feng Wu for their
                            direct involvement in my growth there.
